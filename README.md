# HR Analytics Dashboard

This project showcases an HR analytics dashboard built with [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/). The page visualizes fictional workforce metrics including departmental headcount, hiring versus attrition, employee satisfaction, diversity representation, tenure mix, and work mode preferences.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in any modern browser, or start a simple static server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then browse to <http://localhost:8000/index.html> to view the dashboard.
